# wikiapps

Second WDI Project

Technologies used:
HTML/CSS, Javascript, PostgreSQL & Node JS. I used the following NPMs:
1. express
2. path
3. express-handlebars
4. body-parser
5. method-override
6. postgresql

The application is an internally facing wikipedia page for my hypothetical customer "Henrietta the business magnate". The web application stores and displays articles about mobile applications. The application is a human resource initiative to let users share common apps that are used within the organization. 

Each article page has detailed information that you can edit and save. New articles can be written and categorized.

Challenges/Unsolved problems
1. Need to create search bar
2. Need better styling
